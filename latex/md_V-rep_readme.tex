This node is able to receive some data encoding the joint positions we desire to be achieved by the 7 Baxter arm joints, to simulate the motion of this robot arm due to such inputs and to write inside a document, a txt file, the requested joint configuration at each time instant together with a timestamp. In this way it is possible to have a history of the component itself, since we know when each requested configuration has been sent to the simulator during the whole testing period.\hypertarget{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysection{Getting Started}\label{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md32}
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.\hypertarget{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsection{Prerequisites}\label{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md33}
All the produced code was made on Ubuntu 16.\+04, with the Coppelia\+Sim Edu V4 and R\+OS kinematic, which is the advised configuration.\hypertarget{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysubsection{Installing}\label{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md34}
Obtain a copy of this component
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the copy is not inside the R\+OS workspace source folder, copy the component folder \char`\"{}baxter\char`\"{} from its current position to it, using the graphic interface or the shell command
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mv V-\/rep /absolute/path/of/catkin/workspace/src/V-\/rep}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Activate the bash scripts
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd /absolute/path/of/catkin/workspace/src/V-\/rep}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd src}
\DoxyCodeLine{chmod +x logger\_launcher.sh}
\DoxyCodeLine{chmod +x coppelialaucher.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Do a catkin make inside the catkin workspace main folder
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd /absolute/path/of/catkin/workspace/}
\DoxyCodeLine{catkin\_make}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysection{Running the tests\+: running the simulation with a D\+U\+M\+M\+Y publisher in order to check whether it’s working.}\label{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md35}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Digit \char`\"{}roslaunch V-\/rep baxter\+\_\+test.\+launch\char`\"{} and press enter. In order to start up a master and all this component involved nodes is simply needed to call the launch file baxter\+\_\+test.\+launch by digiting on the shell the command line
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch V-\/rep baxter\_test.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


By doing this the Coppelia\+Sim environment will be opened on the correct scene. Use the user interface to handle the simulation. At this point on the shell a message occurs inviting the user to write a command on it. If you digit ‘help’ a list of all the possible commands is shown. In particular you can\+: -\/start the simulation (‘start’); -\/set the I\+MU reference system such that it coincides with the human end effector one (‘calibration’); -\/put the simulation in pause in order to restart from the last configuration you reached (‘pause’); -\/stop the simulation (‘stop’) leading the robot arm to the default configuration; -\/set a default configuration you like for each one of the 7 joints (‘set\+\_\+default’). In the original default configuration each joint is set to 0. -\/close the user interface, all the running topics and the simulator environment (\textquotesingle{}exit\textquotesingle{})

To change the input rate, the shell commands from inside the “\+V-\/rep” folder are\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd src}
\DoxyCodeLine{gedit publisher\_ROS\_VREP}
\end{DoxyCode}


At line 41 the rate can be changed.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ros::Rate loop\_rate(110);}
\end{DoxyCode}


Then, after saving the file, back again in the shell\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{catkin\_make}
\end{DoxyCode}


In order to apply the changes.\hypertarget{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysection{Deployment}\label{md_V-rep_readme_autotoc_md36}
To deploy to a live system the procedures are identical to the one observed in the test, with the only exception of the roslaunch to activate which is baxter\+\_\+sim.\+launch and the fact that the system needs to publish to the simulation component.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch V-\/rep baxter\_sim.launch}
